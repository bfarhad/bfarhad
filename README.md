# ðŸ‘‹ Greetings random passerby

Hi, my name is Farhad Badalov and I'm a computer geek who like build systems that can be usefull to people. As a child,

I read a forecast in the newspaper that I was destined to sit in a large organization and press a buttons on keyboard, 

which completely predetermined my entire subsequent life, and although I am a big fan of open source, it so happened 

that for the last 7 years I have been working for an enterprise and trying to bring latest innovations like Infrastructure as Code

or  DevOps/SRE culture for make them little bit modern. If you are interested in creation of SRE environment with layered automation of 

cloud environment or your custom project then let me know I can share with you a lot of conception from my experience.
